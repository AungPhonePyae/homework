    <h3>About this book</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The goal of this book is to teach you think like software developer (engineer) or computer scientist. <br> Like mathematicians, software developers use formal languages to denote ideas intern of computational. <br> Like engineers, they design things, assembling componets into systems and evaluating tradeoffs among alternatives. <br> Like scientists, computer scientists observe the behavior of the complex system, from hypothesis and test predictions.</p>

    <!-- Another Paragraph Start -->
    
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most imprtant skill for a computer scientist is problem-solving, ability to formulate problems, <br> think creatively about solutions and finally express a solution clearly and accurately. <br> Study shows that learning how to program is an excellent skill to practice problem-solving skills.</p>
